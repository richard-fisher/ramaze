  module Helper
    ##
    # A relatively basic yet useful helper that can be used to protect your
    # application from CSRF attacks/exploits. Note that this helper merely
    # generates the required data, and provides several methods. You still need
    # to manually add the token to each form.
    #
    # The reason for this is because this is quite simple. Ramaze is meant as a
    # framework that works with any given helper, ORM, template engine and so
    # on. If we were to automatically load this helper and include (a perhaps
    # more advanced) CSRF system that would mean that every form helper,
    # official or third-party, would have to support that specific system.
    # However, there's no need to panic as it's very easy to setup a basic anti
    # CSRF system.
    #
    # ## Usage
    #
    # In order to enable CSRF protection we need to do two things. Load the
    # helper and create a before_all block in a controller. Take a look at the
    # following code:
    #
    #     class BaseController < Ramaze::Controller
    #       before_all do
    #         puts "Hello, before_all!"
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # This would output "Hello, before_all!" to the console upon each request.
    # Not very useful but it does show what the before_all block can do. On to
    # actual CSRF related code!
    #
    #     class BaseController < Ramaze::Controller
    #       before_all do
    #         csrf_protection :save do
    #           # ....
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # This example introduces an extra block that validates the current
    # request. Whenever a user requests a controller that either extends
    # BaseController or has it's own before_all block Ramaze will check if the
    # current request data contains a CSRF token. Of course an if/end isn't
    # very useful if it doesn't do anything, let's add some code.
    #
    #     class BaseController < Ramaze::Controller
    #       before_all do
    #         csrf_protection :save do
    #           puts "Hello, unsafe data!"
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # The code above checks if the current method is "save" (or any other of
    # the provided methods) and checks if an CSRF token is supplied if the
    # method matches. Protected methods require a token in ALL HTTP requests
    # (GET, POST, etc). While this may seem weird since GET is generally used
    # for safe actions it actually makes sense. Ramaze stores both the POST and
    # GET parameters in the request.params hash. While this makes it easy to
    # work with POST/GET data this also makes it easier to spoof POST requests
    # using a GET request, thus this helper protects ALL request methods.
    #
    # If you're a lazy person you can copy-paste the example below and adapt it
    # to your needs.
    #
    #     class BaseController < Ramaze::Controller
    #       before_all do
    #         csrf_protection :save do
    #           respond("The supplied CSRF token is invalid.", 401)
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end

      # Method that can be used to protect the specified methods against CSRF
      # exploits. Each protected method will require the token to be stored in

      # against the current token in the session.
